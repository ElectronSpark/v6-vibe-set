# Linux DRM / GUI ABI Compatibility Plan

Last updated: 2026-06-21.

This is the active handoff plan for Linux GUI/DRM ABI work in
`/home/es/xv6-os`. It intentionally keeps only current gaps and guardrails.
Long historical evidence trails live in git history, ABI audit docs, and run
artifacts.

## Current Direction

KDE Plasma is the primary desktop target. Weston and Chromium remain regression
controls and stress probes, but new work should not modify Weston unless the
user explicitly asks. KDE/Qt/KWin/Plasma source must stay upstream-clean except
for marker-only xv6 metadata. If KDE fails, reduce it to a Linux ABI gap and
prefer fixes in the kernel, libc/sysroot, rootfs data, or build/staging
wrappers.

The current KVM/virgl DRM baseline is healthy enough to run KDE:

- `/dev/dri/card0` and `/dev/dri/renderD128` exist.
- KWin starts on DRM with virgl and reports OpenGL ES 3.1.
- Plasma, Xwayland, kactivitymanagerd, kded, and Konsole can run together.
- The KDE smoke proves a nonblack colorful desktop, visible input response, and
  Konsole launch.
- Linux KDE KVM+virgl baseline and xv6 comparison are recorded in
  `docs/linux-kde-performance-baseline.md`.

## Guardrails

- Do not push without asking.
- Do not touch Weston from this point unless explicitly requested.
- Keep KDE/Qt/KWin/Plasma upstream-clean.
- Treat imported GUI apps as probes, not deliverables.
- Prefer reducer-first debugging for Linux ABI mismatches.
- Do not use static PIDs/TGIDs/TIDs as evidence. Derive roles from argv,
  executable path, thread name, fd/socket graph, lifecycle, surface mapping, or
  SCM/credential traffic in the same boot.
- Use narrow builds:
  - Kernel-only: `cmake --build build-x86_64 --target kernel -j2`
  - Rootfs refresh after sysroot/rootfs/staging edits:
    `cmake --build build-x86_64 --target rootfs-refresh -j2`
  - Avoid broad `world`, toolchain, or aggregate image rebuilds unless the
    changed layer requires them.
- Every visual/runtime proof needs durable logs and screenshots where possible.
  If screenshot capture fails, record that explicitly.
- Keep binary payloads out of git. Stage host/package binaries through the
  build system or Dockerfile/sysroot construction, not the repository tree.

## Current Evidence

### KDE

Passing command:

```sh
timeout 900 scripts/gpu/kde-plasma-desktop-smoke.expect
```

Current artifact directory:

```text
build-x86_64/kde-plasma-desktop-smoke/
```

Key passing evidence:

```text
Xwayland KDE wrapper: EGL_PLATFORM=wayland GALLIUM_DRIVER=virgl MESA_LOADER_DRIVER_OVERRIDE=virtio_gpu glamor=off
kde_kwin_screenshot_probe result=PASS
kde_process_probe ... kwin=1 plasmashell=1 ... xwayland=1 ... konsole=1 ... status=PASS
KDE-PLASMA-DESKTOP-SMOKE-DONE
```

The final rootfs must keep `/usr/bin/Xwayland -> ../../bin/Xwayland`, so KWin
uses the xv6 Xwayland wrapper rather than a package binary copied by an overlay.

### Linux KDE Baseline

Baseline artifact:

```text
build-x86_64/linux-kde-virgl-baseline/20260621-123954/
```

Summary:

- QEMU KVM + `virtio-vga-gl`, Alpine 3.23.4, KDE/Plasma upstream packages.
- Renderer: `virgl (D3D12 (Intel(R) UHD Graphics))`.
- Xwayland/GLX control: `glxgears` at 55.638 FPS.
- QEMU monitor screendump failed with `Error: no surface`; log, renderer, FPS,
  and trace evidence are still valid.

See `docs/linux-kde-performance-baseline.md` for the full comparison table.

## Active Gaps

### 1. Xwayland GLAMOR / GLX Acceleration

Status: open.

The KDE default now guards Xwayland with `XV6_XWAYLAND_GLAMOR=off` to avoid the
broken accelerated path. With automatic GLAMOR enabled, Xwayland reports:

```text
Supported GL version is not sufficient (required 21, found 0)
glGetString() returned NULL, your GL is broken
XWAYLAND: Disabling GLAMOR support
EGL setup failed, disabling glamor
```

This is the main KDE performance gap versus Linux. KWin can create a virgl
OpenGL ES 3.1 context, but Xwayland GLAMOR cannot get the GL 2.1+ context it
expects.

Next reducer:

- Boot with `XV6_XWAYLAND_GLAMOR=auto` in the Xwayland wrapper environment.
- Run the smallest X11/GLX probe available under the KDE session, preferably
  `host-x11-egl-smoke` or a focused GLX reducer.
- Compare Linux versus xv6 for GL/EGL loader choice, `glGetString(GL_VERSION)`,
  GLX context creation, DRI3/Present fd passing, render-node ioctls, and QEMU
  `virtio_gpu_cmd_ctx_create` names.

Success criteria:

- Xwayland starts without the GL version 0/null `glGetString` failure.
- An X11 GL client creates a virgl context under Xwayland.
- QEMU trace shows Xwayland/client 3D submission comparable in shape to the
  Linux baseline.
- Default KDE smoke still passes and remains nonblack/responsive.

### 2. KDE Performance Parity

Status: open after Xwayland acceleration.

The current xv6 KDE desktop is visually correct and responsive, but it does not
yet match the Linux KDE baseline because Xwayland GLAMOR is disabled. After
closing the GLAMOR/GLX gap, add a deterministic KDE/X11 FPS probe comparable to
the Linux `glxgears` control and record it beside
`docs/linux-kde-performance-baseline.md`.

Success criteria:

- KDE smoke passes.
- X11 GL smoke FPS is recorded under xv6.
- QEMU trace counts and renderer logs are captured in a stable artifact.
- Weston/Chromium controls remain green.

### 3. Chromium As Regression / Stress Probe

Status: open only for current reproducible ABI gaps.

Do not reopen old Chromium issues unless a current run reproduces them. Current
Chromium work should focus on:

- Fullscreen YouTube: prove deterministic 720p fullscreen playback and cursor
  motion over a long enough capture window.
- VA/video decode: Mesa Gallium VA is staged, but hardware decode selection is
  not yet proven by Chromium diagnostics. Keep this as an open proof item.
- Normal launcher/minimal flags: continue only from current evidence that
  proves a Linux ABI surface, not from stale first-run/profile artifacts.
- X11 presentation timing should remain separate from native Wayland Chromium
  paths, especially when investigating `GetVSyncParametersIfAvailable()` or
  Xwayland/Present behavior.

Success criteria:

- Current harness artifacts include host HTTP evidence when relevant,
  role-derived Chromium process evidence, screenshot/frame evidence, and a
  reduced ABI explanation for any failure.
- Local video gate stays green after any GPU/DRM-visible change.

### 4. Audio ABI Completeness

Status: partial.

The current audio path is enough for GUI smoke:

- OSS `/dev/dsp` works.
- Minimal ALSA playback hardware enumeration works.
- libasound can play through the current default path.

Remaining gaps are future Linux ABI work only if a real program proves it needs
them:

- ALSA capture.
- mmap PCM.
- async notification.
- timer devices.
- mixer/control richness.
- channel-map/status completeness.

### 5. Kernel Static Analysis Debt

Status: open but not a KDE blocker.

`kernel-sparse` has pre-existing Hyper-V sparse parse/context warnings. Do not
block KDE/virgl work on them, but do run focused kernel builds and `diff
--check` for touched files.

## Regression Gates

Run these when their layer changes:

```sh
git diff --check
git -C kernel diff --check
git -C ports diff --check
cmake --build build-x86_64 --target kernel -j2
cmake --build build-x86_64 --target rootfs-refresh -j2
timeout 900 scripts/gpu/kde-plasma-desktop-smoke.expect
REPO_ROOT=/home/es/xv6-os timeout 320 expect scripts/gpu/perf-video-gate.expect
```

Use Chromium/YouTube and focused X11 probes as targeted controls when the
changed surface can affect them.

## Closed For Current KVM/virgl Target

Keep these out of the active queue unless a new current regression reopens
them:

- Core DRM node bring-up.
- KMS modesetting for current virgl path.
- GBM/EGL/Mesa virgl bring-up for KWin.
- PRIME/dma-buf basics.
- syncobj/sync_file basics.
- vblank basics.
- cursor bring-up for the current GUI path.
- `drmabitest` baseline.
- NetSurf as a primary target.
- Old Weston desktop restoration work.
- Historical Chromium first-run/profile, `/dev/kbd`, `/dev/shm`, procfs maps,
  clone/pidfd, file-lock, stream EOF, and SCM fixes unless a fresh run
  produces a new minimal reducer.

## Out Of Scope

- Chromium sandbox/user namespace/seccomp work, unless explicitly requested.
- Hyper-V DXG/GPU-P native-present work.
- Nouveau/DDA real-hardware support.
- RISC-V graphics.
- Full desktop-service completeness unless reduced to a Linux ABI mismatch.
